Basic Geospatial Workflow

Contains the code necessary to:
 - Generate top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectances from LANDSAT bands and stack them into a multiband raster
 - Read raster, training polygons, and conduct basic ML (unsupervised: kmeans; supervised: naive bayes)
 - Generate a visualization

To do:
 - Add code to TOA_reflectance_stacker to crop the output raster into the study area.
